## Background and summary

There is increased interest in old growth and mature forests in the United States due to the Biden Administration’s Executive Order on [‘Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies’](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/22/executive-order-on-strengthening-the-nations-forests-communities-and-local-economies/).  Which ordered the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to “define, identify, and complete an inventory of old-growth and mature forests on Federal lands and shall make such inventory publicly available”.  Non-profit organizations and local governments in particular have taken an interest in old growth and mature forests in the Central Upper Peninsula.

Here we explore 'late-succession' habitat as defined by LANDFIRE in the [Biophysical Settings models and descriptions](https://landfire.gov/bps-models.php) which is specifically defined for each BpS (historical ecosystem). In LANDFIRE, late-succession was not specifically designed for old-growth/mature forest identification.  We use LANDFIRE data here because:

* There are robust descriptions and ecological models for each ecosystem that have been peer reviewed.  Learn more about the process from [Blankenship et al., (2021)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.3484), and [Swaty et al., (2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/11/1/28/pdf). 
* The datasets and models cover all lands, not just agency lands for example.
* Late succession as defined in the LANDFIRE models and descriptions is 'highly-inclusive', and can serve to highlight areas for more detailed field examinations.
* LANDFIRE's view of ecosystems includes natural disturbances (including Indigenous burning, wildfires, windthrow, etc.), which is in line with current ecological theory.  This is particularly important in disturbance-driven ecosystems such as the Northern Pine(-Oak) Forests which would have had frequent surface fires prior to European Settlement.  These fires resulted in a fair amount of 'Late-Open" successional habitat.

## Change

```{r wrangle late data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## ---------------------------
##
## Script name: Wrangle  BpS and Sclass data inputs
##
## Purpose of script: Clean and merge BpS-Sclass combine, BpS reference percents and sclass descriptions to calculate and make charts for historical vs. current sclass charts, and for exploring different stages of BpSs (e.g., late classes).  This script is an evolution of "wrangle_data" originally written for Mary Kelly's MZ2 late succession project.

## ---------------------------


##  clean and prep raw combined data

clean_bps_scls_cmbn <- raw_bps_scls %>%
  mutate(LABEL = str_replace_all(LABEL, "Developed", "Urban")) %>%
  select(-c(OID_,
            Value,
            LC16_BPS_2,
            LC20_SCla_,
            GROUPVEG)) %>%
  unite("join_field", BPS_MODEL,LABEL, sep = "_", remove = FALSE ) %>%
  group_by(join_field,BPS_MODEL, BPS_NAME, LABEL)  %>%  # I want only one row per unique BpS-sclass combo
  summarize(count = sum(Count)) %>%
  clean_names() 
# note-some BpSs did not have sclasses A-E in mapping rules and/or may not have any pixels of a particular s-class mapped today so there will not be all 10 possible sclasses for each BpS (i.e., A-E, UN, UE, etc.)

## clean and prep sclass descriptions

sclass_descriptions_clean <- sclass_descriptions %>%
  select(-c(Description)) %>% # remove column
  rename("model_code" = "StratumID",
         "scls_label" = "ClassLabelID",
         "state_class_id" = "StateClassID" ) %>% # rename columns
  unite("join_field", model_code:scls_label, sep = "_", remove = FALSE ) %>%
  separate(state_class_id, into = c("age_category", "canopy_category"), sep = ":", remove = FALSE) 


## clean and prep reference percents

# get unique s-class labels from modified ref_con so we can have 'authoritative' list
unique_sclass_labels_ref <- unique(reference_percents$refLabel)
print(unique_sclass_labels_ref)

# there may be some differences in the mapped sclass labels in the cleaned bps_sclass combine
unique_sclass_lables_cmbn <- unique(clean_bps_scls_cmbn$label)
print(unique_sclass_lables_cmbn)
# there are differences, e.g., Urban-Developed between this and sclass label
# will assume Barren/Sparse, NoData and Snow/Ice is minimal; will change "Developed" to "Urban" in reference df cleaning code 

clean_ref_percents <- reference_percents %>%
  mutate(across('refLabel', str_replace, 'Developed', 'Urban')) %>%
  mutate(across('model_label', str_replace, 'Developed', 'Urban')) %>%
  rename("join_field" = "model_label" ) %>%
  clean_names()

## winnow this df to only the bps model codes in area of interest.   Used BPS_MODEL, thought note this may result in duplicate BpS names if the AoI is across multiple variants of a BpS.  There should be 10x the number of unique BPS_MODEL values. Note, this will not be 10x the number of rows in the bps_atts since that is parsed by the "VALUE" field in the clipped BpS dataset, i.e., there may be multiple rows for a single BPS_MODEL because each Map Zone gets a unique "VALUE".  We are working with the BPS_MODEL field as it will have the unique ref conditions we need.  Also, we use the a newly created 'join-field' for joining in GIS.  

# first see how many bpss there are
length(unique(bps_atts$BPS_MODEL))

clean_ref_percents <- clean_ref_percents %>%
  filter(model_code %in% bps_atts$BPS_MODEL)
# should be 10x number of unique BPS_Models (minus one for NAs that are 'water' etc)

## create 'final' dataframe with reference and current sclass percents, acres and labels

## first ref con and sclass descriptions, remove BPS_NAME column to avoid duplication below
final_ref_con <- left_join(clean_ref_percents, sclass_descriptions_clean) 


# looks OK, now full join to add reference percents then clean a bit

ref_con_slcs_count <- full_join(final_ref_con, clean_bps_scls_cmbn, by = "join_field") %>%
  select(-c(bps_model,
            bps_name,
            label,
            scls_label)) %>%
  rename("cur_scls_count" = "count",
          "bps_name" = "bp_s_name")

# now for the math: need count/acres per bps, cur sclass percents and differences

final_df_full <- ref_con_slcs_count %>%
  group_by(model_code) %>%
  mutate(bps_count = sum(cur_scls_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(bps_acres = bps_count*0.2223945,
         ref_scls_acres = bps_acres*(ref_percent/100),
         cur_scls_acres = cur_scls_count*0.2223945,
         cur_percent = (cur_scls_acres/bps_acres)*100) %>%
  mutate(across(11:14, round, 0)) 

final_df_clean <- final_df_full %>%

## Other datasets

Above we explored "late-succession" habitat, which might be considered to be the 'top of the funnel' or widest possible way to look at later stages of ecosystem development.  Below we explore some other related datasets currently available.

### Mature and Old Growth Data from the US Forest Service (USFS)

To support "Executive Order 14072 (also known as “Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities,
and Local Economies”)", USFS scientists have defined and mapped 'mature' and 'old-growth' forests on USFS and Bureau of Land Management lands of the US.  Their definitions are largely based on relatively reliably mapped characteristics of tree diameter and trees per acre. 

We strongly recommend reading the full report, available [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/mature-and-old-growth-forests-tech.pdf), and exploring the [data viewer](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/37cb7e33db6949c79f1f87f87968e51a/page/Simple-View/).

At time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge. 

<br>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='left', fig.cap="Screenshot of the USFS Mature and Old-Growth Forest Map. "}

knitr::include_graphics("images/usfs_mog_viewer.png")

```

<br>

For the Central Upper Peninsula area, a few things stand out from their map:

* There are no 'High Old-Growth' areas.
* High 'Mature/Low Old-Growth' areas are mapped in the eastern portion of the assessment area, largely in line with Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and the western area of the Hiawatha National Forest.

### Mature and Old-Growth mapping effort by Barnett et al. (2023)

In a recently published [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.1070372/full), Barnett et al. (2023) classified, inventoried and mapped mature and old-growth (MOG) forests for the US.  Whereas many MOG mapping attempts use some combination of tree height and/or age and/or density, the authors assessed carbon accumulation, and assumed (briefly) that old-growth occurred:

> "...at the age when the density of total forest carbon stored in live and dead biomass reaches 95% of the empirically derived maximum, and the mature forest stage as occurring between the peak average carbon increment and the age of onset of old growth." 

At time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge. However from Figure 8 in the paper a few patterns jump out:

* Most of the Upper Peninsula is mapped as 'young' or 'mature'.  
* There appear to be scattered pixels (small areas) with 'Old-Growth' scattered around the area, with no discernible concentrations of old-growth. 

### Mature and Old-Growth Contributions project by DellaSala et al. (2022)

Authors of this [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.979528/full) used combinations of forest canopy height, cover and above-ground living biomass to map mature and old-growth forests (among many other things).  To summarize, the authors held workshops with scientists to develop 'rulesets' or thresholds of the three aforementioned parameters for each of 28 forest types groups, then combined the necessary datasets to map mature and old-growth forests.  

The authors do share their datasets at https://www.matureforests.org/data.  Here's a quick map of 'mature' forest pixels for the analysis area.

<br>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='left', fig.cap="Map of mature areas as mapped by Della-Sala et al. (2022). "}

knitr::include_graphics("images/della_sala_mature.jpg")

```

This map most closely aligns with ours, identifying a substantial amount of the analysis area as 'mature'.
