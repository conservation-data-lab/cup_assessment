    "text": "Other datasets\nAbove we explored “late-succession” habitat, which might be considered to be the ‘top of the funnel’ or widest possible way to look at later stages of ecosystem development. Below we explore some other related datasets currently available.\n\nMature and Old Growth Data from the US Forest Service (USFS)\nTo support “Executive Order 14072 (also known as “Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies”)“, USFS scientists have defined and mapped ‘mature’ and ‘old-growth’ forests on USFS and Bureau of Land Management lands of the US. Their definitions are largely based on relatively reliably mapped characteristics of tree diameter and trees per acre.\nWe strongly recommend reading the full report, available here, and exploring the data viewer.\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the USFS Mature and Old-Growth Forest Map.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Central Upper Peninsula area, a few things stand out from their map:\n\nThere are no ‘High Old-Growth’ areas.\nHigh ‘Mature/Low Old-Growth’ areas are mapped in the eastern portion of the assessment area, largely in line with Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and the western area of the Hiawatha National Forest.\n\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth mapping effort by Barnett et al. (2023)\nIn a recently published paper, Barnett et al. (2023) classified, inventoried and mapped mature and old-growth (MOG) forests for the US. Whereas many MOG mapping attempts use some combination of tree height and/or age and/or density, the authors assessed carbon accumulation, and assumed (briefly) that old-growth occurred:\n\n“…at the age when the density of total forest carbon stored in live and dead biomass reaches 95% of the empirically derived maximum, and the mature forest stage as occurring between the peak average carbon increment and the age of onset of old growth.”\n\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge. However from Figure 8 in the paper a few patterns jump out:\n\nMost of the Upper Peninsula is mapped as ‘young’ or ‘mature’.\n\nThere appear to be scattered pixels (small areas) with ‘Old-Growth’ scattered around the area, with no discernible concentrations of old-growth.\n\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth Contributions project by DellaSala et al. (2022)\nAuthors of this paper used combinations of forest canopy height, cover and above-ground living biomass to map mature and old-growth forests (among many other things). To summarize, the authors held workshops with scientists to develop ‘rulesets’ or thresholds of the three aforementioned parameters for each of 28 forest types groups, then combined the necessary datasets to map mature and old-growth forests.\nThe authors do share their datasets at https://www.matureforests.org/data. Here’s a quick map of ‘mature’ forest pixels for the analysis area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of mature areas as mapped by Della-Sala et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map most closely aligns with ours, identifying a substantial amount of the analysis area as ‘mature’."

Logging practices may have influenced fire frequency and intensity. Early 20th Century Fire Suppression:\nFire suppression efforts became prevalent in the early 20th century, impacting the natural fire regime. This led to the accumulation of fuels, potentially increasing the risk of intense wildfires. Mid-20th Century Policy Shift:\nPolicies promoting fire suppression began to change in the mid-20th century, recognizing the ecological role of fire. Prescribed burns were occasionally used to mimic natural fire regimes and restore ecosystems. Late 20th Century:\nIncreased understanding of fire ecology led to a more nuanced approach, combining fire suppression with controlled burns to manage vegetation and reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires."

LANDFIRE data does not allow for direct exploration of this type.\nWhile both ‘current’ and ‘historical’ vegetation maps were created with LANDFIRE data, there are differences in naming conventions due to evolving science and the datasets were created using very different approaches (e.g, existing vegetation mapped with satellite data, historical vegetation was modeled). Because of those differences only general trends can be assessed.\n\nAs noted above historical information presented for context.

One way to ameliorate some of the data comparison challenges is to ‘group’ types and look at general patterns. For example we can group then compare all ‘riparian’ types to explore trends. It is important to interpret changes as being changes in what was mapped, which may or may not be actuality.\nIn the chord diagram below, you can hover over an outer band (e.g., near the phrase ’ Past Hardwood’ on the right) to see how much of an historical area is still mapped as that type, and how much is different. For example, of what was mapped as ‘Hardwood’ types historically, most is still that type today, with some being mapped as other types such as ‘Developed’."
