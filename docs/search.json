A few notable patterns include:\n\nThere have not been substantial changes in general, i.e., the area was dominated by riparian and northern hardwood types.\nThe ‘Aspen-Birch’ type that is mapped on the current landscape may have also occurred historically, but may have been a ‘developmental stage’ within an ecosystem. LANDFIRE data does not allow for direct exploration of this type.\nWhile both ‘current’ and ‘historical’ vegetation maps were created with LANDFIRE data, there are differences in naming conventions due to evolving science and the datasets were created using very different approaches (e.g, existing vegetation mapped with satellite data, historical vegetation was modeled). Because of those differences only general trends can be assessed.\n\nAs noted above historical information presented for context. It does not necessarily equal a ‘Desired Future Condition’.\nTo learn about the dataset, visit https://landfire.gov/bps.php , and to explore specific types, including descriptions, go to https://landfirereview.org/search.php."

    "text": "General comparisons-another way to explore\nAs noted above, making comparisons between the ‘current’ and ‘historical’ ecosystem datasets can be problematic. One way to ameliorate some of the data comparison challenges is to ‘group’ types and look at general patterns. For example we can group then compare all ‘riparian’ types to explore trends. It is important to interpret changes as being changes in what was mapped, which may or may not be actuality.\nIn the chord diagram below, you can hover over an outer band (e.g., near the phrase ’ Past Hardwood’ on the right) to see how much of an historical area is still mapped as that type, and how much is different. For example, of what was mapped as ‘Hardwood’ types historically, most is still that type today, with some being mapped as other types such as ‘Developed’."

To create the polygon by which we completed our analysis, we:\n\nSelected the 6 central-most counties from the Census Bureau County Dataset (500m). Exported this data as a shapefile.\nUsed the ‘Select by Location’ tool with the U.S. HUC 8 Watershed Boundary from Data Basin and the 6 selected CUP counties as the ‘Selecting Features’. Data exported as a shapefile, projected to the NAD 1983 coordination system (WKID 4269).\n\nThis work was completed in ArcGIS Pro."
