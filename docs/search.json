    "text": "Late succession habitat: Sugarloaf Recreation Area\nOne area of interest in the central Upper Peninsula is the Sugarloaf Recreation Area near Marquette. It’s dominated by northern hardwoods ecosystems, including the ‘pine-hemlock-hardwood’ and ‘northern hardwoods-hemlock’ systems. We mapped no late succession habitat for the northern hardwoods-hemlock type; most of the late succession habitat in this area belongs to the pine-hemlock-hardwood system. As noted in this web report late-succession does not necessarily mean ‘old-growth’ which can have a more narrow definition. Additionally, late-succession for this type is defined rather broadly: white pines, hemlocks and yellow birches greater than 10M tall, with canopy cover greater than 50%."

    "text": "Other datasets\nAbove we explored “late-succession” habitat, which might be considered to be the ‘top of the funnel’ or widest possible way to look at later stages of ecosystem development. Below we explore some other related datasets currently available.\n\nMature and Old Growth Data from the US Forest Service (USFS)\nTo support “Executive Order 14072 (also known as “Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies”)“, USFS scientists have defined and mapped ‘mature’ and ‘old-growth’ forests on USFS and Bureau of Land Management lands of the US. Their definitions are largely based on relatively reliably mapped characteristics of tree diameter and trees per acre.\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the USFS Mature and Old-Growth Forest Map.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Central Upper Peninsula area, a few things stand out from their map:\n\nThere are no ‘High Old-Growth’ areas.\nHigh ‘Mature/Low Old-Growth’ areas are mapped in the eastern portion of the assessment area, largely in line with Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and the western area of the Hiawatha National Forest.\n\nWe strongly recommend reading the full report, available here, and exploring the data viewer.\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth mapping effort by Barnett et al. (2023)\nIn a recently published paper, Barnett et al. (2023) classified, inventoried and mapped mature and old-growth (MOG) forests for the US. Whereas many MOG mapping attempts use some combination of tree height and/or age and/or density, the authors assessed carbon accumulation, and assumed (briefly) that old-growth occurred:\n\n“…at the age when the density of total forest carbon stored in live and dead biomass reaches 95% of the empirically derived maximum, and the mature forest stage as occurring between the peak average carbon increment and the age of onset of old growth.”\n\nAt time of this assessment, raw data was not available for further assessment to our knowledge. However from Figure 8 in the paper a few patterns jump out:\n\nMost of the Upper Peninsula is mapped as ‘young’ or ‘mature’.\n\nThere appear to be scattered pixels (small areas) with ‘Old-Growth’ scattered around the area, with no discernible concentrations of old-growth.\n\n\n\nMature and Old-Growth Contributions project by DellaSala et al. (2022)\nAuthors of this paper used combinations of forest canopy height, cover and above-ground living biomass to map mature and old-growth forests (among many other things). To summarize, the authors held workshops with scientists to develop ‘rulesets’ or thresholds of the three aforementioned parameters for each of 28 forest types groups, then combined the necessary datasets to map mature and old-growth forests.\nThe authors do share their datasets at https://www.matureforests.org/data. Here’s a quick map of ‘mature’ forest pixels for the analysis area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of mature areas as mapped by Della-Sala et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map most closely aligns with ours, identifying a substantial amount of the analysis area as ‘mature’."

We use LANDFIRE data here because:\n\nThere are robust descriptions and ecological models for each ecosystem that have been peer reviewed. Learn more about the process from Blankenship et al., (2021), and Swaty et al., (2021).\nThe datasets and models cover all lands, not just agency lands for example.\nLate succession as defined in the LANDFIRE models and descriptions is ‘highly-inclusive’, and can serve to highlight areas for more detailed field examinations.\nLANDFIRE’s view of ecosystems includes natural disturbances (including Indigenous burning, wildfires, windthrow, etc.), which is in line with current ecological theory. This is particularly important in disturbance-driven ecosystems such as the Northern Pine(-Oak) Forests which would have had frequent surface fires prior to European Settlement. These fires resulted in a fair amount of ’Late-Open” successional habitat."

There, Wildfire Likelihood ‘is the probability of wildfire burning in any given year. At the community level, wildfire likelihood is averaged where housing units occur. Communities in all but the lowest classes need to be prepared for wildfire.’\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Wildfire Likelihood from the Wildfire Risk to Communities website, https://wildfirerisk.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wildfire Exposure assessment relies primarily on landscape classification and the assigned flammability hazard for each Existing Vegetation Type. Alternativily, the Wildfire Risk to Communities incorporates weather and climate conditions, fuel model comparisons, and historical ignition data to predict burn probability and potential fire intensity. Although both assessments may appear similar, a notable difference emerges in the southern area adjacent to Lake Michigan. It’s crucial to recognize the limitations of fire behavior models, especially when dealing with varied inputs that are generalized. As climate change progresses, relying on sparse ignition records, broad weather data, and generalized fuel flammability assessments, particularly in lake states, can lead to significant gaps and exaggerations in the analysis (Ziel, personal communication)."

    "text": "Methods\n\nArea of Interest\nWe aimed to delineate an analysis area that would both meet planning purposes of county officials in the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan (CUP) and be ecologically meaningful. To create the polygon by which we completed our analysis, we:\n\nSelected the 6 central-most counties from the Census Bureau County Dataset (500m). Exported this data as a shapefile.\nUsed the ‘Select by Location’ tool with the U.S. HUC 8 Watershed Boundary from Data Basin and the 6 selected CUP counties as the ‘Selecting Features’. Data exported as a shapefile, projected to the NAD 1983 coordination system (WKID 5070).\n\n\n\nGeneral GIS\nFor initial data processing for all tabs we clipped raster datasets to the area of interest using the ‘Clip Raster’ tool. We retained the LANDFIRE standard projection (see LANDFIRE Standard Projections) and resolution. This work was completed in ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\nInput Raster Datasets\n\nLANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type - Ecological Systems (EVT) for the ‘Ecosystems’ and ‘Wildfire Exposure’ tabs.\nLANDFIRE Biophysical Settings spatial data (BpS) for the ‘Ecosystems’ and ‘Late Succession’ tabs.\nLANDFIRE Biophysical Settings Reference Conditions Table for the ‘Late Succession’ tab.\nLANDFIRE Succession Class (SCLS) for the ‘Late Succession’ tab.\n\nAll clipped datasets are available in the ‘data/spatial’ directory of the repository located here.\n\n\nTab-specific Methods\nEcosystems: After datasets were clipped as noted above, we used QGIS for cartography, limiting the legends in the maps for clarity. The attribute tables were exported for the charts. Attribute tables are located in the ‘data/’ directory of the repository located here, with the names ‘bps_aoi_attributes.csv’ and ‘evt_aoi_attributes.csv’.\nMaking of the chord diagram was a bit more involved, utilizing the following steps:\n\nCombined the BpS and EVT spatial datasets using the ‘Combine’ tool in ArcGIS Pro.\nUsed the ‘Join field’ tool in ArcGIS pro to attach relevant attributes.\nUsed a Pivot Table in Excel to format and clean data to make the final chord dataset (see bps2evt_chord.csv file in the ‘data/’ directory of this repo).\n\nR code for all charts available in the ‘current.qmd’ file of this repo.\nLate succession habitat: There are essentially two components of this analysis: 1) estimating reference amounts of late-succession, and quantifying current amounts of late succession. For this analysis we used the methods and code of Kelly and Swaty, 2024..\nWildfire Exposure:\nThis method was orignially developed and documented by Beverly et al., 2021, and adapted by us as documented in this document.\n\n\nSoftware and Tools\nThis work was completed in ArcGIS Pro. R, R-Studio and QGIS were also used in the analyses. All code and datasets can be obtained by contacting Randy Swaty."

    "text": "The area and approach\nAs anyone who lives in the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan knows, it’s a place where temperatures can range from well below zero to above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (though that is rare), snowfall can total more than 200” in a single winter and where leaves are on the ground for longer than they are on trees.\n\n\n\nPhoto of crosscountry skiier, central UP, by Randy Swaty.\n\n\nThe ecosystems range from very dry jack pine barrens to northern hardwoods (includes sugar maple and yellow birch trees) growing on relatively fertile and well-balanced soils to wetlands (such as alkaline swamps with cedars and tamarack).\nMany of landscapes are very heterogeneous, meaning that you can easily walk, ride, ski or drive through many ecosystems in a short time. For example in the Yellow Dog Plains (north-central Marquette county) it’s possible to traverse those aforementioned ecosystems in a short distance. Here we explore where the ecosystems were, where they are today, where the late succession stages of those ecosystems are, and where wildfire exposure risk is the highest. Through harvests, prescribed fire (and fire suppression), altering water flow (e.g. through road development), we are changing these ecosystems. Some specific examples include:\n\nfires historically ‘cleaned’ fire-adapted ecosystems such as the norther pine-oak system, periodically removing needles and branches (i.e., fuels) that accumulate on the forest floor. Fire suppression halts this ‘cleaning’, leading to an accumulation of fuels. Prescribed fire and some types of harvest can reduce fuel buildup.\nroad systems can alter water flow (hydrology) in multiple ways: 1) capturing and redistributing precipitation into ditches, 2) blocked flow when culverts are plugged, 3) increasing/decreasing water on either side of a road depending on natural direction of flow (so called ‘damming effect’) and 4) changes in temperature (which can lead to changes in organisms and chemical processes).\ntree harvests can result in obvious effects depending on type of harvest including: altered species composition, overall tree height and canopy closure. These changes can in turn impact soil development, understory species composition, wildlife habitat and fuels accumulation.\n\nWe do not answer questions such as ‘where should we do fuel reduction projects to reduce wildfire risk’ or ‘should we set-aside areas that will not be harvested’ in this web report. Rather, we present background information that might help managers with those and other related questions. More specifically, we:\n\nWorked with planners from Marquette County to determine the ‘area of interest’.\nFormatted, summarized and displayed freely available datasets to depict ecosystems past and present, late-succession habitat past and present, and wildfire exposure risk.\nOrganized the information into this web report.\n\nFor more information on methods and input data see the ‘About’ page.\n\n\n\nScenes across the UP, from left to right, all photos by Randy Swaty except where noted: canoeing in Luce County by Danielle Miller, prescribed fire on the Hiawatha National Forest, Bechler March in the eastern UP and a kid enjoying a central UP river."
