## Patterns on the current landscape

* Almost all of the area is naturally vegetated, with ~ 5% classified as 'Agricultural' and ~2% classified as 'Developed'.  
* Just over 1/4 of the CUP is classified as Northern Hardwoods Forest, and 1/4 as Alkaline Conifer-Hardwood Swamp.
* In total, ~37% is typed in various 'riparian' ecosystems.

## Historical ecosystems


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.align='left', fig.cap="Dominant ecosystems just prior to European colonization, map created with Biophysical Settings data from https://landfire.gov/bps.php."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/bps.jpg")

```

<br> 

**For context** (not necessarily direct comparison as datasets generated using different methods), we mapped the dominant ecosystems that would have been in the CUP just prior to European Settlement.  A few notable patterns include:

* There have not been substantial changes in general, i.e., the area was dominated by riparian and northern hardwood types.
* The 'Aspen-Birch' type that is mapped on the current landscape may have also occurred historically, but may have been a 'developmental stage' within an ecosystem. LANDFIRE data does not allow for direct exploration of this type.
* While both 'current' and 'historical' vegetation maps were created with LANDFIRE data, there are differences in naming conventions due to evolving science and the datasets were created using very different approaches (e.g, existing vegetation mapped with satellite data, historical vegetation was modeled).  Because of those differences only general trends can be assessed. 

*As noted above historical information presented for context.  It does not necessarily equal a 'Desired Future Condition'.*

## General comparisons-another way to explore

As noted above, making comparisons between the 'current' and 'historical' ecosystem datasets can be problematic. One way to ameliorate some of the data comparison challenges is to 'group' types and look at general patterns.  For example we can group then compare all 'riparian' types to explore trends.  It is important to interpret changes as being changes in what was mapped, which may or may not be actuality.

In the chord diagram below, you can hover over an outer band (e.g., near the phrase ' Past Hardwood' on the right) to see how much of an historical area is still mapped as that type, and how much is different.  For example, of what was mapped as 'Hardwood' types historically, most is still that type today, with some being mapped as other types such as 'Developed'.

#convert to matrix
matrix_df <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(as_tbl_graph(chord_df),attr = "ACRES"))

#clean up matrix (could be cleaner!)
matrix_df = subset(matrix_df, select = -c(1:6))

matrix_df <- matrix_df[-c(7:15),]
