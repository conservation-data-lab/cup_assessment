## Patterns on the current landscape

![Photo of autumn in the northern hardwoods, central UP, by Randy Swaty.](images/fall.jpg){style="float:right; margin-left: 5%; fig-align:right; width:25%;" fig-alt="\"Photo of autumnal coniferous and deciduous trees where the deciduous trees are various shades of reds, oranges and yellows."}

Using [LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type](https://landfire.gov/evt.php){target='none'} data, we mapped and quantified patterns of the most dominant ecosystems in the central Upper Peninsula as of 2022.  For clarity most dominant ecosystems were mapped (ones that covered more than 5% of the landscape). Lists and quantities of all ecosystems are available by contacting Randy Swaty (rswaty@tnc.org).  



**We found:**

* Almost all of the area is naturally vegetated, with ~ 5% classified as 'Agricultural' and ~2% classified as 'Developed'.  
* Just over 1/4 of the CUP is classified as [Northern Hardwoods Forest](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.1207720/Acer_saccharum_-_Betula_alleghaniensis_-_Picea_glauca_Forest_Macrogroup){target='none'}, and 1/4 as [Alkaline Conifer-Hardwood Swamp](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.723030/Laurentian-Acadian_Alkaline_Conifer-Hardwood_Swamp){target='none'}.
* In total, ~37% is typed as various 'riparian' ecosystems.
* Broadly, the northern hardwoods forests are located more in the northern part of the region, with wetland/riparian types in the mid and southern parts.  [Jack pine-red pine](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.899362/Pinus_banksiana_-_Pinus_resinosa_-_Quercus_ellipsoidalis_Forest_Woodland_Alliance){target='none} types are scattered throughout.

*Use caution when comparing the Current and Historical ecosystem maps.  The input datasets and methods are not directly comparable.*

## Historical ecosystems

Using a historical ecosystems dataset from LANDFIRE we explored how the central Upper Peninsula looked prior to European Colonization.  

**We found:**

* There have not been substantial changes in general, i.e., the area was dominated by riparian and northern hardwood types historically.
* The 'Aspen-Birch' type that is mapped on the current landscape may have also occurred historically, but may have been a 'developmental stage' within an ecosystem. LANDFIRE data does not allow for direct exploration of this type.

*Historical information presented for context.  It does not necessarily equal a 'Desired Future Condition', and should be compared with current situation for trend exploration only.*

## For the so-inclined: other ways to explore change

As noted above, making comparisons between the 'current' and 'historical' ecosystem datasets should only be done to explore trends.  We "grouped" ecosystems into broader types for a exploration of past vs. present. 

### Chord Diagram

In the chord diagram below, you can hover over an outer band (e.g., near the phrase 'Past Hardwood' on the right side of the chord diagram) to see how much of a historical area is still mapped as that type, and how much is different. 

For example, if you hover over the outer green "Past Hardwood-Conifer" band you will see that roughly half has transitioned to "Hardwood" and a substantial portion has transitioned to "Conifer" in current mapping. 

**Some trends you might notice:**

* Some of the 'past conifer' has transitioned to 'hardwoods'.
* The area of interest does not have much 'Developed' area mapped.
