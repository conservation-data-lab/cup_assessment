## Patterns on the current landscape

Using [LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type](https://landfire.gov/evt.php) data, we mapped and quantified patterns of the most dominant ecosystems in the central Upper Peninsula as of 2022.  

**We found:**

* Almost all of the area is naturally vegetated, with ~ 5% classified as 'Agricultural' and ~2% classified as 'Developed'.  
* Just over 1/4 of the CUP is classified as Northern Hardwoods Forest, and 1/4 as Alkaline Conifer-Hardwood Swamp.
* In total, ~37% is typed in various 'riparian' ecosystems.

## Historical ecosystems

Using a historical ecosystems dataset from LANDFIRE we explored how the central Upper Peninsula looked prior to European Colonization.  

**We found:**

* There have not been substantial changes in general, i.e., the area was dominated by riparian and northern hardwood types historically.
* The 'Aspen-Birch' type that is mapped on the current landscape may have also occurred historically, but may have been a 'developmental stage' within an ecosystem. LANDFIRE data does not allow for direct exploration of this type.

## General comparisons-another way to explore

As noted above, making comparisons between the 'current' and 'historical' ecosystem datasets should only be done to explore trends.  We "grouped" ecosystems into broader types for a exploration of past vs. present. 

In the chord diagram below, you can hover over an outer band (e.g., near the phrase ' Past Hardwood' on the right) to see how much of an historical area is still mapped as that type, and how much is different. 

**Some trends you might notice**

* Some of the 'past conifer' has transitioned to 'hardwoods'.
* The area of interest does not have much 'Developed' area mapped.
