## Wildfire Exposure Risk-Introduction and concepts

PLACEHOLDER TEXT FROM CHAT GPT

>Mapping wildfire exposure risk involves the integration of diverse data sources and advanced analytical techniques to identify and assess areas susceptible to wildfire incidents. Leveraging satellite imagery, climate data, vegetation types, and historical fire patterns, the mapping process aims to quantify the level of risk in different regions. Machine learning models can play a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of wildfire occurrence, considering factors such as weather conditions, topography, and human activities. The resulting risk maps provide valuable insights for proactive wildfire management strategies, enabling authorities and communities to allocate resources effectively, implement preventative measures, and plan evacuation routes to mitigate the impact of potential wildfires. This comprehensive approach not only aids in understanding the spatial distribution of wildfire exposure risk but also facilitates informed decision-making to enhance overall wildfire resilience.

Decision Support System:

* Functions as a decision support system for stakeholders, offering clear and interpretable information to guide effective decision-making in wildfire management.
Continuous Improvement and Feedback Loop:

* Establishes a feedback loop for continuous improvement, allowing the refinement of models and strategies based on the outcomes of past wildfire events and ongoing monitoring efforts.
Public Awareness and Education:

* Enhances public awareness through the dissemination of risk maps, fostering a better understanding of wildfire exposure and encouraging responsible behavior to minimize fire risks.

## Another view-Wildfire Risk to Communities

>Copied placeholder text from https://wildfirerisk.org/explore/wildfire-likelihood/26/ .  Wildfire likelihood is the probability of wildfire burning in any given year. At the community level, wildfire likelihood is averaged where housing units occur. Communities in all but the lowest classes need to be prepared for wildfire.

PLACEHOLDER TEXT FROM CHAT GPT

Pre-European Settlement Era:

Native American communities in the Upper Peninsula (UP) likely influenced fire regimes through intentional burning for various purposes, such as promoting vegetation for hunting and agriculture.
1800s Logging Era:

Extensive logging activities in the 19th century altered the landscape, with increased slash and debris providing fuel for fires. Logging practices may have influenced fire frequency and intensity.
Early 20th Century Fire Suppression:

Fire suppression efforts became prevalent in the early 20th century, impacting the natural fire regime. This led to the accumulation of fuels, potentially increasing the risk of intense wildfires.
Mid-20th Century Policy Shift:

Policies promoting fire suppression began to change in the mid-20th century, recognizing the ecological role of fire. Prescribed burns were occasionally used to mimic natural fire regimes and restore ecosystems.
Late 20th Century:

Increased understanding of fire ecology led to a more nuanced approach, combining fire suppression with controlled burns to manage vegetation and reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires.
